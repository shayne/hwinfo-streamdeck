# HWiNFO Stream Deck Plugin

## ⚠⚠ Major refactor landed in pre-release v2.0.0, plugin code open sourced, remote monitoring infrastructure support ⚠⚠

>## Thank you & Looking for Maintainers
>
>Thank you everyone who has used and enjoyed this plugin. It started as a passion project and I continue to use it day to day. I am happy to finally release the full source on GitHub. When I first built it, it was closed under agreement with the HWiNFO64 project. They have since opened up the shared memory interface and now the plugin is freely open.
>
>I haven't had the time to dedicate to this project in some time and appreciate everyone for hanging in there. I hope to work with some of you who are eager to take the project over. I am happy and ready to hand over the reigns. If there are development questions I'm happy to share my thoughts on the code and structure that exists.

## Enabling Support in HWiNFO64
